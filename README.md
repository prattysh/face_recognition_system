# Face Emotion Detection System

## Project Overview
This project implements a real-time face emotion detection system using computer vision with OpenCV (`cv2`) and deep learning. It analyzes facial expressions captured from a webcam or video input to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.

## Key Features
- Real-time emotion recognition from live video feed
- Deep learning model trained to accurately identify multiple facial emotions
- Uses OpenCV for face detection and preprocessing
- Includes trained model file for emotion classification

## Dataset and Model
The model is trained on a dataset of facial images labeled with emotion categories. The trained model is saved as `emotiondetector.h5`.

## Future Work
Potential improvements include expanding emotion categories, enhancing accuracy with more training data, and developing a user-friendly graphical interface.
